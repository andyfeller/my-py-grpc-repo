# Python gRPC Stack

This template repository contains the bare-bones Python gRPC stack I used when starting a new project.  I am always on the lookout for ways to improve this boilerplate, please feel free to contribute!

## Why should you use this stack?
This stack spins up an example Python-based gRPC server in a Docker container.
